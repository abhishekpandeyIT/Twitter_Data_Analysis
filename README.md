# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
Wrangle and Analyze Data Project for Udacity's Data Analysis Nanodegree.

## Introduction
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 6 million followers and has received international media coverage.

## Softwares Used

- Jupyter Notebook.
- The following packages (libraries) need to be installed.
   - pandas
  - NumPy
  - requests
  - tweepy
  - json

- You need to be able to create written documents that contain images and you need to be able to export these documents as PDF files. 

# Project Specifications
## Functionality and Readability
- All project code is contained in a Jupyter Notebook named wrangle_act.ipynb and runs without errors.
- The Jupyter Notebook has an intuitive, easy-to-follow logical structure. 
- The code uses comments effectively and is interspersed with Jupyter Notebook Markdown cells. 
- The steps of the data wrangling process (i.e. gather, assess, and clean) are clearly identified with comments or Markdown cells, as well.

## Gathering Data
- Data is successfully gathered From at least the three different sources and in three different file formats on the Project Details page.
- Each piece of data is stored into a separate pandas DataFrame.

## Assessing Data
1. Two types of assessment are used:
   - **Visual assessment:** each piece of gathered data is displayed in the Jupyter Notebook for visual assessment purposes. Once displayed, data can additionally be assessed in an external application say MS Excel.
   - **Programmatic assessment:** pandas library of python is used to assess the data.
2. At least eight (7) data quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues are detected, and include the issues to clean to satisfy the Project Motivation. Each issue is documented in one to a few sentences each.

## Cleaning Data
- The define, code, and test steps of the cleaning process are clearly documented.
- Copies of the original pieces of data are made prior to cleaning.
- All issues identified in the assess phase are successfully cleaned using Python and pandas.
- A tidy master dataset with all pieces of gathered data is created.

## Storing and Acting on Wrangled Data
- Save master dataset to a CSV file.
- The master dataset is analyzed using pandas in the Jupyter Notebook.
- At least one (1) labeled visualization is produced in the Jupyter Notebook using Pythonâ€™s plotting libraries.

## Report
Two reports:
- Wrangling efforts are briefly described in wrangle_report.pdf.
- The insights of foundings are communicated in act_report.pdf including visualization.
